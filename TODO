TODO:

- use XFontSets:
	- look at XTerm/fontutils.c:
		- bold_name_font()
		- derive_font_name()
		- get_font_name_props()

- colors:
	- color array -> DONE
	- load all colors in array -> DONE
	- 16-231: + 0x28
	- 232-255: + 0xA0A0A -> DONE

- Xresources:
	- font -> DONE
	- geometry -> DONE
	- border-width -> DONE
	- colors: 0-16 -> DONE

- Selections:
	- get selection:
		- primary -> chunk size?
		- clipboard
	- set selection:
		- primary
		- clipboard -> DONE

- X error handlers:
	- see xsel

- Atoms:
	- use XInternAtoms where possible?
	- do we need to re-get CLIPBOARD every time it's needed?
		- don't think so: Xmu has _XA_CLIPBOARD, which does not change

- create list of supported atoms for selrequest TARGETS?

EXTRAS:

- reload configuration file on receive SIGUSER1
- print selected text to stdout, so that a script can pick up urls and open them in a browser
